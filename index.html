        <p>Hi! My name is Patrick aka Sner and i'm a surfing enthusiast. Born in the highlands of Ethiopia, I learnt how to surf on the backs of gorillas. At the sprightly age of 11, I moved to the Swedish alps and began my career as a professional sherper. In the offtime, I honed my skills at backgammon and became a world-class player. If you have any questions, or wish to my hire me for my specialised skills, don't hesitate to contact me at sner@sner.surf</p>
